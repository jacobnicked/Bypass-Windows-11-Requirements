# Bypass Windows 11 Requirements
A .bat file that adds the registry keys allowing a user to install Windows 11 on an unsupported hardware.

- TPM bypass
- Processor bypass
- RAM bypass
- Secure Boot bypass
- Allowing upgrades with an unsupported TPM or CPU

Download the .bat file and run it as an administrator. 

v1.0 - The program closes itself after adding the registry keys.
v2.0 - New appearance and confirming making any changes - enter 'yes', 'no', or 'undo' (more in the v2.0 release)

If you want to use the file while the Windows 11 installer is running (installing a fresh copy, bootable pendrive/drive), put the file either on an external drive or a partition that Windows 11 is not about to be installed onto, but on another one.
