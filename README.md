# Bypass Windows 11 Requirements
A .bat file that adds the registry keys allowing a user to install Windows 11 on an unsupported hardware.

Download the .bat file and run it as an administrator. The program closes itself after adding the registry keys.

If you want to use the file while the Windows 11 installer is running (installing a fresh copy), put the file either on an external drive or a partition that Windows 11 is not about to be installed onto, but on another one.
